Haxxcel Chatbot Platform Specification
🎯 Project Goal
Build a scalable, production-grade SaaS platform named Haxxcel Chatbot (similar to Chatbase.co) enabling businesses to create customizable, AI-powered chatbots with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) support. The platform must support all available large language models (LLMs) and voice models, including Google Gemini, Grok, LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen, and others, with user-configurable API keys, connection testing, and model selection. Google is the default provider for all models, including voice models. The system includes multi-channel deployment (websites, Shopify, WhatsApp, etc.), third-party tool integrations, file/image/voice input support, real-time analytics, webhooks, and white-label plans. When embedded on a website, the chatbot must display a footer in the chat window with a clickable "Powered by Haxxcel Solutions" button redirecting to https://haxxcelsolutions.com. The platform will be built using Firebase Studio for seamless frontend and backend development, with a user dashboard and master admin panel for management.

Workflow:
Users interact with the dashboard to create chatbots, configure LLMs/voice models, and connect tools.
Real-time updates (e.g., analytics, conversation history) are powered by Firebase Realtime Database.
Firebase Studio’s drag-and-drop editor is used to design layouts, with custom code for advanced features (e.g., model selection, webhook configuration).


Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile using responsive layouts and Tailwind CSS.

Backend Implementation

Framework: Firebase Functions (Node.js) for serverless backend logic, integrated with Firebase Studio for deployment.
Components:
Authentication: Firebase Authentication for user management (email, OAuth, MFA).
Database: Firebase Firestore for storing user data, chatbot configurations, API keys, webhook settings, white-label branding, and chat history.
Storage: Firebase Storage for documents, images, and audio files.
API Integrations:
LLM APIs: RESTful endpoints to call Google AI API (default), OpenAI, Anthropic, etc., with connection testing logic.
Voice APIs: Endpoints for Google Cloud Speech-to-Text/Text-to-Speech, Whisper, Deepgram, etc.

Workflow:
Firebase Functions handle API requests (e.g., chatbot creation, model selection, webhook triggers).
Serverless architecture ensures scalability, with Firebase Hosting serving the frontend.
API key validation and model listing are performed via Firebase Functions, calling provider APIs (e.g., Google AI API’s model list endpoint).
Real-time analytics are computed and stored in Firestore, with triggers updating the frontend.
White-label configurations are applied dynamically based on Firestore data, removing the "Powered by Haxxcel Solutions" footer for Enterprise users.



Complete Working Overview

User Flow:

In the Firebase Studio-built dashboard, users create a chatbot named Haxxcel Chatbot, upload data (files, URLs, images), and configure a system prompt.
Users select an LLM provider (default: Google) and input/test an API key. The dashboard displays all available models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemma 3).
Users enable voice support, selecting Google Cloud Speech-to-Text (default) or another provider, with connection testing.
Users connect tools (e.g., Shopify, Google Sheets) via a drag-and-drop interface, with OAuth handled by Firebase Functions.
Chatbots are deployed to channels (website, WhatsApp, etc.) using embed codes or API keys generated by Firebase. Website embeds include a footer with a "Powered by Haxxcel Solutions" button redirecting to https://haxxcelsolutions.com (except for white-labeled chatbots).
Real-time analytics (conversation volume, API usage) are displayed in the dashboard, powered by Firestore and Chart.js.
Webhooks are configured to trigger external systems on events, with logs in the dashboard.
Enterprise users enable white-label plans, customizing branding via the dashboard, which removes the "Powered by Haxxcel Solutions" footer.
